01 - Getting Started

Introduction:
The purpose of this problem is to get you started.  It's just the basics: 
Read a text file
Write a text file.

The contest programs are judged by a text file you create.  
The name of the text file you create  must contain the problem number 
and your team name, like 01-TeamName.txt.

The answer file contains only the answer.  Don't submit the programs you
created, just submit the answer.  

Often you'll  read an input text file, and do something with that input.
The input file is named Input-01.txt for problem 1.

Problem 01:

Read a number from a text file and write "Hello" that many times.

Input:
Filename Input-01.txt contains a single line with a single integer.


Output:
Write 'Hello' n times on separate lines, where "n" is the number contained
in the input file.

Don't put in any quotes, just the word Hello on each line. 
The judging software is case sensitive, just so you know.

Write your answers in a file named 01-TeamName.txt, one answer per line.


Example:
3

Answer:
Hello
Hello
Hello
