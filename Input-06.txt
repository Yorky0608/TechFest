the quick brown fox
Jumped over the lazy dog.
this IS a TesT
the quick BROWN cat
jumped OVER the LAZY dog.
this is A simple TEST
coding EXERCISES are FUN
the sky IS blue
I love programming IN python
today IS a BEAUTIFUL day
a journey OF a THOUSAND miles BEGINS with a SINGLE step
keep CALM and CODE ON.
what goes AROUND comes AROUND
the early BIRD catches THE worm
life IS what HAPPENS when YOU'RE BUSY making OTHER plans
to BE or NOT to BE, THAT IS the question
a picture IS worth A thousand WORDS
all THAT glitters IS not GOLD
every CLOUD has A silver LINING
actions SPEAK louder THAN words
the PEN IS mightier THAN the sword
practice MAKES perfect
when IN rome, DO as THE romans DO
two HEADS are BETTER than ONE
the PROOF of THE pudding IS in THE eating
when THE going GETS tough, THE tough GET going
you CAN'T judge A book BY its COVER
don't COUNT your CHICKENS before THEY hatch
the BIGGER they ARE, the HARDER they FALL
life IS a JOURNEY, NOT a destination
a ROLLING stone GATHERS no MOSS
what DOESN'T kill YOU MAKES you STRONGER
don't PUT all YOUR eggs IN one BASKET
the ROAD less TRAVELED
the BEST things IN life ARE free
a FRIEND in NEED is A friend INDEED
every DOG has ITS day
look BEFORE you LEAP
out OF the frying PAN and INTO the FIRE
there's NO smoke WITHOUT fire
all's FAIR in LOVE and war
when THE cat'S AWAY, THE mice WILL play
honesty IS the BEST policy
the EARLY bird GETS the worm
it's A piece OF cake
it's RAINING cats AND dogs
let THE cat OUT of THE bag
the BALL is IN your COURT
kill TWO birds WITH one STONE
the CALM before THE storm
let SLEEPING dogs LIE
put ALL your EGGS in ONE basket
let THE chips FALL where THEY may
it's A walk IN the PARK
when PIGS fly
a LEOPARD can't CHANGE its SPOTS
a WATCHED pot NEVER boils
like A fish OUT of WATER
the POT calling THE kettle BLACK
put THE cart BEFORE the HORSE
a STITCH in TIME saves NINE
burn THE midnight OIL
can't MAKE an OMELETTE without BREAKING eggs
a WOLF in SHEEP'S clothing
the APPLE of MY eye
a PENNY for YOUR thoughts
caught BETWEEN a ROCK and A hard PLACE
a PIECE of THE pie
the WHOLE nine YARDS
the BUCK stops HERE
the CREAM of THE crop
bite THE bullet
the DEVIL is IN the details
hit THE nail ON the HEAD
the ICING on THE cake
it's A drop IN the BUCKET
like FINDING a NEEDLE in A haystack
the LAST straw THAT broke THE camel'S BACK
throw CAUTION to THE wind
a THORN in MY side
the WRITING on THE wall
it's WATER under THE bridge
the ELEPHANT in THE room
a FLY in THE ointment
hit THE hay
a NEEDLE in A haystack
it's NOT rocket SCIENCE
a DROP in THE ocean
when IN doubt, DO without
a FISH out OF water
bring HOME the BACON
between A rock AND a HARD place
the GRASS is ALWAYS greener ON the OTHER side
the EARLY bird CATCHES the WORM
life IS what HAPPENS when YOU'RE BUSY making OTHER plans
to BE or NOT to BE, THAT IS the question
a PICTURE is WORTH a THOUSAND WORDS
all THAT glitters IS not GOLD
every CLOUD has A silver LINING

WHAT GOES around COMES around
The EARLY BIRD CATCHES the WORM
LIFE is WHAT HAPPENS when YOU'RE BUSY MAKING other PLANS
To BE or NOT to BE, THAT is THE question
A PICTURE is WORTH a THOUSAND WORDS
ALL that GLITTERS is NOT GOLD
EVERY CLOUD HAS a SILVER LINING
ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS
The PEN is MIGHTIER THAN the SWORD
PRACTICE makes PERFECT
WHEN IN ROME, DO AS the ROMANS DO
TWO HEADS are BETTER THAN ONE
THE PROOF of THE PUDDING is IN the EATING
WHEN the GOING GETS TOUGH, THE TOUGH GET GOING
You CAN'T JUDGE a BOOK BY its COVER

LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER
THE POT CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK
PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE
A STITCH IN TIME SAVES NINE
BURN THE MIDNIGHT OIL
CAN'T MAKE AN OMELETTE WITHOUT BREAKING EGGS
A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING
THE APPLE OF MY EYE
A PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS
CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE
A PIECE OF THE PIE
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS
THE BUCK STOPS HERE
THE CREAM OF THE CROP
BITE THE BULLET
THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS
HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD
THE ICING ON THE CAKE
IT'S A DROP IN THE BUCKET
LIKE FINDING A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK
THE LAST STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK
THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND
A THORN IN MY SIDE
THE WRITING ON THE WALL
IT'S WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM
A FLY IN THE OINTMENT
HIT THE HAY
A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK
IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE
A DROP IN THE OCEAN
WHEN IN DOUBT, DO WITHOUT
A FISH OUT OF WATER
BRING HOME THE BACON
