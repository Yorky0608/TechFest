06 - Title Case

You are given a list of sentences. Each sentence may have a mix of 
lowercase and uppercase letters. Convert each sentence to title case.

Title case conversion means that the first letter of each word in a 
sentence should be capitalized, while the remaining letters should be 
in lowercase. However, there are exceptions: the words 
"and" "or" "but" "the" "a" "an" and "at" 
should remain in lowercase unless they appear 
at the beginning of a sentence.

Write a program to perform this title case conversion.

Input:
The input file, "Input-06.txt" will contain one or more sentences. Each 
sentence is a string of words separated by spaces. Sentences may contain 
letters, numbers, and punctuation. The length of each sentence will not 
exceed 1000 characters.

Output:
Write your answers in a file named 06-TeamName.txt, one sentence per line.
