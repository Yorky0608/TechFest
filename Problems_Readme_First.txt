Here are the basics to score points:

1) All contest programs read input data from a text file and write output 
to a text file.  

2) The judging software reads the output text file and judges the answer as 
right or wrong.  

Input:
1) Most problems require reading an input text file, and doing something 
with that input.  

2) Input files are named Input-01.txt for problem 1, Input-02.txt for 
problem 2 and so on.

3) Some problems require looking up words in a dictionary.  The filename 
for the dictionary is "wordlist.txt".

Output:
1) The output filename must contain the problem number and your team name. 

For example, for team "MySchool", the output filename for the first 
problem would be named:  01-MySchool.txt.

2) The output file must contain only the answer.  Don't submit the program 
you used, just submit the answer.  

3) The judging software is case sensitive.

4) Don't put in any extra quotes or capital letters.
