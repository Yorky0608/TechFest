08 - Magic Squares

A magic square is a square grid of integers.  Every row, column and diagonal will add up to the same number.

Input consists of the numbers of one row on one line, separated by commas. The remaining rows follow on the next lines.

There will be more than one square in the input data and they vary in size.

Evaluate each square and determine if it is a magic square.  If it is a magic square, output a 'Y'.  If not, output a line of text with 'N'.  The judging software is case sensitive.
